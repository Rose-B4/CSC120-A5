- What are your initial impressions of how `Association` affects your programming?
    It's pretty cool. I have done all of the different types of association in the past, but I have never really given much thought as to what the differences might be.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    I feel like I would tell someone new to the class to not worry about what to do with the FuelType class. I spent a while trying to figure out what it was for, and while I'm not 100% sure, my general understanding is it is meant to be mostly aesthetic.
